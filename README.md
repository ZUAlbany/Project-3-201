# Project-3-201
From an IECE/ICSI 201 at UAlbany, final project 3 fall of 2023 semester.

The goal of this Project was to act like you were ordering from a hardware store. The program reads from a text file, you can search for items, see if there's a discount, order them, review your orders, and the orders are also saved to a different text file.

I received a 100% on this final project. The excessive comments are from his requirements, friends got points off for not putting enough comments so there is a comment on nearly every line.
